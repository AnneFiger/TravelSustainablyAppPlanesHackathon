# React To The Future Hackathon

## The Brief

The intention of this brief is to allow for creativity whilst also providing an array of robust building blocks to work with. To do this we are providing a set of REST APIs all centring around topics that we care about: sustainability and community.

Utilising these APIs you will produce a product that enables communities to connect, humans to be more sustainable or industry to cater to a more diverse world. You may use as many APIs as you like, however you only need to use at least one.

## Getting Started

Before you start digging into the APIs we recommend downloading [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) (or an alternative such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/)), this will allow you to easily send and receive data from the APIâ€™s and make it easy to inspect the data.

You can find more infomation about the API's and all the documentation [here.](https://www.notion.so/planesstudio/6fda8698d27648229741d3be013c7fe5?v=89f5d252a9e8417f930a162ad2a781f8)

In this repository you will find a template of a single page application in React. Feel free to create your own or use this to get started in your teams.

## How we will judge your work

On Sunday Afternoon, your team will deliver a 5 minute presentation of your work. The awards will be decided by our panel of expert judges.

Award categories are:

- Most engaging product pitch - this is about how you share your product with us. Can you explain your concepts and processes in an engaging and exciting way. Does your presentation make the judging panel want to use the app? Do all members of your team have a role in the pitch?

- Best user experience - have you considered the user journey through the app? have you made the app easy to use and navigate?
  visual impact - does your app look amazing?

- Green credentials - have you considered how your app impacts the environment and how you would reduce impact when making it live?

- Innovation - this is an award for ideas and individuality - does your app do something really new and unique? Does the app say something about you and your interests?
- API exploration - have you made best use of the API(s) available to you? Have you accessed a lot of different endpoints in a relevant and cohesive way?
